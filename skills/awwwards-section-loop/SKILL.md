description: Use when recreating or rebuilding a multi-section page from a reference site — build section by section instead of all at once. Teaches the loop map (analyze_page_structure bands → capture_component per section → build → verify_build per-band score → lock → next), selector fallback rules learned from real captures, when a page must be treated as one unit (shared WebGL canvas), and the lock-before-next discipline that stops compounding drift. Pairs with awwwards-motion-study (motion recipe per section) and verify_build (the score gate).

# Awwwards Section Loop — build section by section, verify each, lock it

Building a whole page in one pass loses: attention splits across eight
sections, an early mistake silently propagates into every later one, and
feedback arrives only when everything is finished — too late to trace the
drift to the decision that caused it. The section loop fixes all three:
**one section gets full attention; each section is verified and locked
before the next starts; drift is caught where it began.**

The tools to run this loop already exist. This skill is the order to run
them in, and the judgment calls the tool outputs don't make for you.

## The loop

```
PLAN          analyze_page_structure(reference)   → band map = section plan
FOR EACH      capture_component(section selector) → section pack (recipe)
              build that section                  → in your output, fully
              verify_build(yours, reference)      → read THAT band's score
              iterate until the band passes       → then LOCK it
NEXT SECTION  (do not touch locked sections again)
FINALLY       whole-page verify_build             → coherence pass
```

### Step 0 — Plan from the band map

`analyze_stack` first (one call): the site's framework, CSS framework, and
marker libs. A Webflow or WordPress source means conventions you re-skin;
a Next source means you can mirror component shapes. Then
`analyze_page_structure` returns ordered bands with `top`, `height`,
`bg`, and a text sniff. Treat the band list as the build order:

- **Small count, sane heights** (≤ ~3,000 px each) → bands map 1:1 to
  build sections.
- **One giant band** (5,000 px+) → the band collapsed multiple real
  sections (repeated `<section class="…">` siblings do this). Do not
  build it as one giant component. Drop to the raw page HTML and pick
  **explicit selectors** for the real sections (`.section`, `[role=…]`,
  `header`, `footer`, or `#id`s), one per logical section. Real-capture
  finding: a 20,631 px band held an entire main content area; the four
  real sections inside it captured fine by class.
- **Shared canvas / WebGL hero** spanning many bands → **the page does
  not slice.** Treat that canvas region as ONE unit: `capture_pose_3d`
  for the camera path, rebuild as a single component, then loop
  normally for everything after it. Slicing a shared-canvas page into
  per-section captures produces sections that each reference a canvas
  none of them own.

### Step 1 — Capture per section

`capture_component(selector)` per section, in band order. Selector
discipline (learned from real captures, in priority order):

1. Section class or id from the band/HTML (`.process`, `.pricing`,
   `.footer`) — most reliable.
2. `role` attributes (`[role="banner"]`, `[role="contentinfo"]`).
3. Tag names (`header`, `footer`, `nav`) — **last resort**: real sites
   frequently have no `<header>` element at all (a real capture of a
   Webflow site returned `selector not found: header` while `nav` and
   `.footer` worked).

If a selector misses, try the alternatives before shrinking the plan.
A failed capture with `selector not found` is a selector problem, not
a missing section.

### Step 2 — Build one section, completely

Build the section against its pack: layout from the pack's geometry,
tokens (fonts/colors/spacing) from its captured computed styles, motion
from the census (`analyze_scroll_map` + `analyze_hover_census` scoped to
the section, per awwwards-motion-study). Content is yours — structure,
motion, and tokens are what you're matching.

**Finish it.** A half-built section pollutes the next verify. No
placeholder blocks left "for later" inside a section you're about to
lock.

### Step 3 — Verify the band, not the page

`verify_build` compares your in-progress build against the reference
and scores **per band**. After building section N, run it and read
**band N's score** — ignore later bands (not built yet → noisy) and
earlier bands (locked).

Iterate on section N until its band passes (typically score ≥ the
target you set up front — B+ per the audit doctrine, or "band beat
last iteration"). Then stop touching it.

**Why the score gate matters:** section-by-section without a verify
gate is just chunked guessing. The band score is the loop's contract —
it converts "looks close" into a number that either passes or names
what's off (geometry, tokens, motion).

### Step 4 — Lock before next

Locking = this section's markup/styles/motion are frozen. If a later
section reveals a problem that truly requires changing a locked section,
make the change **as an explicit re-open**: fix, re-verify that band,
re-lock. Never silently fudge a locked section while building another.

### Step 5 — Final coherence pass

After the last section locks: whole-page `verify_build`, read every
band. You're now checking cross-section things the per-section loop
can't see: shared spacing rhythm, consistent header behavior, scroll
continuity, one easing family across sections (or an intentional
break). Fix coherence issues at the page level (tokens, shared CSS),
not by re-opening sections unless a band regressed.

## Failure modes this skill prevents

| Failure | What you'd see | The rule that prevents it |
|---|---|---|
| Giant collapsed band built as one component | One "section" with 6 sub-layouts, all mediocre | Step 0 explicit-selector split |
| Selector miss treated as missing section | Whole region skipped in the rebuild | Step 1 alternatives ladder |
| Sliced shared-canvas page | Sections that each expect a canvas nobody renders | Step 0 one-unit rule |
| Placeholder left inside a "finished" section | Band score never converges | Step 2 finish-it rule |
| Drift compounding through the page | Every band slightly worse than the last | Steps 3–4 verify+lock |
| Lock-fudging | Locked band regresses unnoticed | Step 4 explicit re-open |
| Per-section sections that don't rhyme | Page reads as stitched screenshots | Step 5 coherence pass |

- `awwwards-motion-study` — the per-section motion recipe (record →
  inventory → build → re-record).
- `verify_build` — the per-band score gate (steps 3 and 5).
- `capture_pose_3d` — camera path for shared-canvas units (step 0).
- `analyze_scroll_map` / `analyze_hover_census` - per-section motion
  census to build from.
- `build_gsap_stub` - turns the captured censuses into a runnable
  GSAP+ScrollTrigger stub (durations, easings, scrub/pin, camera from
  `capture_pose_3d`, reduced-motion guard) — step 2's motion wiring, generated.
